<img src="images/big_logo.png"/>

The MCP starter pack is a repository built for McMaster students interested in trying out or learning more about competitve programming. We'll include solutions and links to a variety of programming problems that we enjoyed solving at MCP and continually update this repo. For the studious few there will be interesting articles, books, or videos that we recommend reading/watching to upgrade your Algorithm and Data Strucuture tool belt.

## FAQ

### Why should I do Competitve Programming?

Competitve programming is a great way to practice for technical interviews. The problems that you solve during these contests are very simliar to the types of questions you get asked during coding interviews most of the time even harder. Additonally, participating in live competitions is an amazing way to practice to remain calm and solve algorithm questions in a timed and stressful enviroment.

Also it's fun! :)
